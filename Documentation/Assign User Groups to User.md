<ins>Project Overview</ins>  
The main goal is to integrate user groups into the system and functions within the system are linked to these user groups. users can be assigned to these groups and this allows administrators to efficiently manage both users and their access permissions to the system.

<ins>Features and Functionalities</ins>  
- when user login we can put assign functions into **JWT**
- user can have many user groups, put check boxes (and infinite scrolling if necessary **may be in future**)
- if there is many user groups need a scrolling just only affect for user group list
- create new function name for user groups called "assign user group"
- hard code to assign newly created users to be in "READS" group
- this form and user groups creating form should only visible for relevant users
- **pagination** needed for users panel
